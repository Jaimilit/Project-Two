DESIGN

I chose a to create this page in keeping with a punk rock theme. The background I have chosen is a wallpaper/collage of punk rock bands. It is in keeping with the punk rock style. I have chosen 3 main colors here - white, black, and red - all very punk rock. The title is simple and the red background makes it pop. And the start button is big, so you can't miss starting the game. For font, I have used Monsterrat which is easy to read 

FEATURES

Languages Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

Typography
I have chosen Monsterrat font because it is easy to read

Start Page

The title always appears on the screen.
The start button I made big so the user cannot miss it.

Questions Page

The user is presented with a 10 questions quiz game about punk rock music. 
The user is presented with 10 questions and 4 choices for each question. 
I also have used a hover effect when the user hovers over the 4 choices so he/she cannot make a mistake when clicking on the choices.

The user immedately knows how he/she is doing on the quiz. Once chosen an answer, the incorrect answers are changed to red and the correct answer is changed to green. The color of the text also goes from black before answering to white after answering for easy readability. 

All the buttons are the same size for the choices. The start button and next are big for easy access for the user.
The user also has to choose a response before the next button appears. This is so he/she does not skip a question and is forced to provide an answer first. 

The scoreboard also keeps tally of correct and incorrect responses so that the user knows how he/she is doing at all times during the game. This way, at the end there will be no surprises in the final tally.

End Page
At the end of the quiz the score board is removed and a final score is provided. It also announces to the user that the game is over. 
The user is provided with a restart button if he/she would like to try again. I kept the button small as I wanted the focus to be on the final score for the user.

Responsiveness

The website is adapted to be seen on different screen sizes. The responsiveness of the website was first tested by chrome developer tools. Different breakpoints where used to view the website. Next to this the website was viewed on different devices: laptop, tablet and smartphones.

I have tested that my projects works on various browsers - Safari, Chrome, and FireFox. I also have confirmed that my project is responsive by using the devtools toolbar. I confirm that all sections, heading, body, & footer, are readable and easy to understand. 


Validator Testing
HTML No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
![HTML Validator](//assets/images/html-checker.jpg)

Unfixed Bugs
In the future I would like to increase my accessibility score, as well as my performance score. I think the more I work at coding and become familiar with best practices, that these scores will become better and better. In the future I would like to add a timer to countdown for each question.

Deployment
For this project I used GitHub

* Log into GitHub.
* Locate the GitHub Repository that shall be deployed live.
